# Problem Introduction
Now, you are interested in minimizing not the number of segments, but the total cost of a flight. For this
you construct a weighted graph: the weight of an edge from one city to another one is the cost of the
corresponding flight.

# Problem Description
**Task.** Given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with n vertices and m edges as well as two
vertices u and v, compute the weight of a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum total
weight of a path from u to v).
**Input Format.** A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.
**Constraints.** 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 , 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, u != v, 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, edge weights are non-negative integers not exceeding 10^3.
**Output Format.** Output the minimum weight of a path from u to v, or −1 if there is no path.
