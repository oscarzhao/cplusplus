# Problem: Computing the Minimum Number of Flight Segments

## Problem Introduction
You would like to compute the minimum number of flight segments to get from one city to another one. For
this, you construct the following undirected graph: vertices represent cities, there is an edge between two
vertices whenever there is a flight between the corresponding two cities. Then, it suffices to find a shortest
path from one of the given cities to the other one.

## Problem Description
**Task.** Given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges and two vertices u and v, 
compute the length of a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v).

**Input Format.** A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.
**Constraints.** 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= 10^5, u != v, 1 <= u; v <= n.
**Output Format.** Output the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v, or -1 if there is no path.
