# Problem Introduction

Now, when you are sure that there are no cyclic dependencies in the given CS curriculum, you would like to
nd an order of all courses that is consistent with all dependencies. For this, you nd a topological ordering
of the corresponding directed graph.

# Problem Description
**Task.**Compute a topological ordering of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n vertices and m edges.
**Input Format.** A graph is given in the standard format.
**Constraints.** 1 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= 10^5. The given graph is guaranteed to be acyclic.
**Output Format.** Output any topological ordering of its vertices.
