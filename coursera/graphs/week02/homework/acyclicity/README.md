# Problem Introduction

A Computer Science curriculum speci es the prerequisites for each course as a list of courses that should be
taken before taking this course.  You would like to perform a consistency check of the curriculum, that is, to
check that there are no cyclic dependencies.  For this, you construct the following directed graph:  vertices
correspond to courses, there is a directed edge (u, v) is the course u should be taken before the course v.
Then, it is enough to check whether the resulting graph contains a cycle.

# Problem Description
**Task.**Check whether a given directed graph with n vertices and m edges contains a cycle.
**Input Format.** A graph is given in the standard format.
**Constraints.** 1 <= n <= 10^3, 0 <= m <= 10^3.
**Output Format.** Output 1 if the graph contains a cycle and 0 otherwise.
